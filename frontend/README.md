# Frontend React App (Vite + React + TypeScript + MUI)

This is the new frontend application built with React and Vite.

## Development

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-react/frontend-react-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if yarn is preferred)

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (or `yarn dev`)

This will start the development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
